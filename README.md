# NodeJS Core Concepts

Welcome! 👋 This project was created as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of **Core Node.js practices**. The goal is to explore and experiment with the fundamental concepts that make up modern backend development with Node.js.

## 📚 Based On

This project is based on the course **[NodeJS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/)** by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller**. The course has been an incredible resource for learning both the fundamentals and advanced features of Node.js.

## 🔍 What I'm Learning

This project focuses on the following Node.js concepts:

- **Creating HTTP servers** – Handling requests and responses natively with Node.js
- **Express.js framework** – Building scalable and maintainable backend APIs
- **Middleware** – Using and creating middleware functions for request processing
- **Routing** – Defining RESTful endpoints and managing route handlers
- **Authentication & Security** – Implementing user auth and securing endpoints
- **Database Integration** – Connecting to MongoDB and performing CRUD operations
- **Error Handling** – Managing exceptions and improving app robustness
- **Testing** – Writing unit and integration tests for backend logic
- **Deployment** – Preparing apps for production and deploying to cloud platforms
- **And More** – Other Node.js ecosystem tools and best practices

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js (latest LTS)
- Express.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- Jest or similar testing frameworks
- Docker (optional)
